# NACA-4-NeMo

This repository demonstrates training a graph neural operator using the PhysicsNeMo library.
The example solves the unsteady 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for flow over a NACA
4-series airfoil.

## Training

Install dependencies including `nemo_toolkit` with the physics extras and run the training
script:

```bash
python train_gno_naca4.py
```
